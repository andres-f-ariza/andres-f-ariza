            <h1>What is artificial intelligence?</h1>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of 
                performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but 
                advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.</p>
            <img src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/Why-get-certified-in-Artificial-Intelligence.jpg" class="small" id="smart_thumbnail">
            <h1>An opportunity for impact in small businesses</h1>
            <h2>Big idea</h2>
            <p>Every small business has its own dynamics in clients, products, sales, etc. I think that we can build a much richer society if 
                we can enable AI developments that can be customizable for small businesses needs of AI.</p>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Nowadays AI is largely concentrated in the big tech companies. Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build, 
                they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. And the large tech companies, particularly the ones 
                with hundreds of millions or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off because, 
                for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search or that recommends better products for online shopping,
                 can be applied to very large numbers of users.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, there
                 are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics.
                For example, a local pizza store with great pizza, that always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different 
                flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. 
                And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the 
                right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him 
                to make more of it on a Friday afternoon.
                </p>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>The small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify the cost of hiring an AI team. And <strong>every restaurant is
                different with a different menu, different customers, different ways of recording sales that no one-size-fits-all AI would 
                work for all of them.</strong> What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses to use AI? </p>
            <h2>Solution proposal</h2>
            <p>For most of the last few decades, if you wanted to build an AI system. You have to write several pages of code. But not everybody 
                knows how to. But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate, there are emerging new 
                AI development platforms that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code to asking you to focus on providing data. And 
                this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do. In the case of the pizza store, a demand forecasting IA.
                We can start to empower every small business owner to build their own AI systems, because AI is creating tremendous wealth and 
                will continue to. And it's only by democratizing access to AI that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across 
                society. Hundreds of years ago. I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy will have. 
                </p>
            <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
            <p>Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people, but that does not have to be the case. In the coming era for AI, we’ll 
                empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I think that will be incredibly exciting future.</p>
